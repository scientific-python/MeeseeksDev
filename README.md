# MeeseeksBox

A base for stateless GitHub Bot,and one hosted implementation thereof.

See what is a [Meeseeks and a MeeseeksBox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUYvIAP3qQk).

See [usage statistics](https://meeseeksbox.github.io/).

## Hosted for you

We host MeeseeksBox(es) and will expose them as GitHub Integrations so you don't
have to host and run your own. You can if you want, it should be pretty
simple.

The advantage of having one and only one box, is to do cross repository
operations (and fix security bugs).

The drawback is if there is a security issue, then we're screwed.

## Activate on your Repo

1. Head [there](https://github.com/apps/lumberbot-app/) and activate
   MeeseeksDev on repos you have access to.

1. On a repository with MeeseeksDev installed say: `@MeeseeksDev Hello` to be
   sure MeeseeksDev is correctly installed.

1. Enjoy

You might also want to tell your CI-integration (like travis-ci) **not** to test the **push** __and__ **the merge**.
To do so use:

```
branches:
  except:
    - /^auto-backport-of-pr-[0-9]+$/
```

## per-repository configuration

If you want per-repository configuration, create a `.meeseeksdev.yml` file at
the root of the repository. For now this file allow you to give fine-grained
permissions to users.

```
users:
  <username>:
    can:
      - <command 1>
      - <command 2>
      - ...
  <username>
    can:
      - ...
```

This will allow `<username>` to ask `@meeseeksdev` to perform above commands.
The conf file is the one that sits on the repository default  branch (usually
`master`).

## What can a MeeseeksBox do ?

Comment on a Pr or issue.

You _may_ put multiple commands, one per line.

MrMeeseeks _may_ not like what you ask, and just ignore you.

### @MeeseeksDev hello

Respond with

> Hello {user} look at me, I'm Mr Meeseeks

To test whether a Meeseeks understand you.

### @MeeseeksDev backport \[to\] {branch}

If issued from a  PR which is merged, attempt to backport (cherry-pick the
merge commit) on an older branch and submit a PR with this backport (on said branch)

Apply origin-pr labels and milestone to backport.

- No option to push directly (yet), if implemented should apply only with clean backport.
- Investigate what to do in case of conflict
  - likely commit with conflict, and let maintainers resolve conflict

Repo admins only

Note: Cloning can take a long-time. So expect MrMeeseeks to be busy while this
happen. Also heroku has a 2min deadline and other limitations, so MrMeeseeks can
likely be killed. I haven't implemented a queue yet.

### @MeeseeksDev black

If issued from a PR, will apply black to commits made in this PR and push
the updated commits.

You can also use "blackify" as an alias.

Repo admins only, we plan to make it available to PR authors as well.

MeeseeksDev Bot needs to be installed on the PR source repository for this to work.
If it's not it will ask you to do so.

### @MeeseeksDev pre-commit

If issued from a PR, will apply pre-commit to this PR and push
a commit with the changes made.  If no changes are made, or the changes
cannot be automatically fixed, it will show a comment in the PR and bail.

You can also use "precommit" as an alias.

Repo admins only, we plan to make it available to PR authors as well.

MeeseeksDev Bot needs to be installed on the PR source repository for this to work.
If it's not it will ask you to do so.

### @MeeseeksDev pep8ify

(in progress)

If issued from a PR, will apply autopep8 to the current lines changed by this
PR, and push an extra commit to it that fixes pep8.

Code in progress and due to GitHub API limitation only works if MeeseeksDev
also available on Source repo of the PR.

Repo admins only, plan to make it available to PR author as well.

MeeseeksDev Bot need to be installed on the PR source repository for this to work.
If it's not it will ask you to do so.

### @MeeseeksDev migrate \[to\] {target org/repo}

Needs MeeseeksBox to be installed on both current and target repo. Command
issuer to be admin on both.

MeeseeksDev will open a similar issue, replicate all comments with links to
first, migrate labels (if possible).

### @MeeseeksDev close

Close the issue. Useful when replying by mail

### @MeeseeksDev open

Reopen the issue.

### @MeeseeksDev tag {comma, separated, case sensitive, taglist}

Tag with said tags if availlable (comma separated, need to be exact match)

### @MeeseeksDev untag {comma, separated, case sensitive, taglist}

Remove said tags if present (comma separated, need to be exact match)

### @MeeseeksDev merge \[merge|squash|rebase\]

Issuer needs at least write permission.

If Mergeable, Merge current PR using said methods (`merge` if no arguments)

## Command Extras

You can be polite and use "please" with any of the commands, e.g. "@Meeseeksdev please close".

You can optionally use the word "run" in the command, e.g. "@Meeseeksdev please run pre-commit".

## Simple extension.

Most extension and new command for the MeeseeksBox are only one function, for
example here is how to let everyone request the zen of Python:

````python
from textwrap import dedent

@everyone
def zen(*, session, payload, arguments):
    comment_url     = payload['issue']['comments_url']
    session.post_comment(comment_url,
    dedent(
        """
        Zen of Python ([pep 20](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/))
        ```
        >>> import this
        Beautiful is better than ugly.
        Sparse is better than dense.
        ....
        Although never is often better than *right* now.
        Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
        ```
        """
    ))
````

The `session` object is authenticated with the repository the command came from.
If you need to authenticate with another repository with MeeseeksBox installed `yield` the `org/repo` slug.

```python
@admin
def foo(*, session, payload, argument):
    other_session = yield 'MeeseeksBox/MeeseeksBox'
    if other_session:
        print('you are allowed to access MeeseeksBox/MeeseeksBox')
        other_session.do_stuff()
    else:
        session.post_comment("Sorry Jerry you are not allowed to do that.")
```

# Why do you request so much permission ?

GitHub API does not allow to change permissions once given (yet). We don't want
you to go though the process of reinstalling all integrations.

We would like to request less permission if necessary.

# Setup.

See CONTIBUTING.md for for information.

# Warnings

This is still alpha software, user and org that can use it are still hardcoded.
If you want access open an issue for me to allowlist your org and users.

Because of GitHub API limitation, MeeseeksBox can not yet make the distinction
between read-only and read-write collaborators.
